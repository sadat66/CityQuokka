## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or above recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (You can install pnpm via `npm install -g pnpm`)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadat66/CityQuokka.git
   cd CityQuokka
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   Use `pnpm` to install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will install the packages listed in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the server, and you should be able to view the project in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whichever port is configured).

## Build for Production

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will bundle the project, optimizing it for production.

## Start the Production Server

Once the project is built, you can start the production server with this command:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

This will serve the optimized build from your local server.

## Additional Commands
